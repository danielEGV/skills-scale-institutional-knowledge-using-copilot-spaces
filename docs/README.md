# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This README serves as the central hub for all of our processes and best practices.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses a modern, agile-inspired approach to manage cross-functional projects:

- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety**: encourage feedback and learning.

### Key Principles

Our project management framework is built on these core principles:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, and confirm go/no-go for planning
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and timelines
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and regular demos
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with verified quality and documented rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and maintain code quality
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and ensure acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and strategic guidance

## Quick Start for New Team Members

1. Start with the [Project Management Overview](./octoacme-project-management-overview.md) for a high-level understanding of our approach
2. Find your role in [Roles and Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to understand your responsibilities
3. Navigate to the relevant phase documentation based on your current project stage
4. Reference the checklists and templates throughout the docs as you execute your work

## How to Use These Docs

- **Keep project charters updated** in your project repository during active work
- **Add process-specific docs** to `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to reference them as context
- **Contribute improvements** by submitting issues or pull requests when you identify gaps or have suggestions
- **Stay current** by reviewing updates and new documents as they're published

## Communication Cadence

For optimal project execution, follow this communication rhythm:

- **Daily**: Team standups (15 min focus on progress, blockers, dependencies)
- **Weekly**: PM + PdM sync and delivery team standups
- **Weekly**: Risk register review and blocker escalation
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates
- **Per sprint/milestone**: Planning, demos, and retrospectives
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalations as needed
